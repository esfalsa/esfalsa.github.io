Today, I'm writing my first blog post. And with some luck, someone may actually read it.

I wasn't planning to start my blog with an introductory post, but rather by starting a journal of my progress with [another project](https://github.com/esfalsa/codico). I still _am_ working on that, but suffice it to say that progress is a little slower than I predicted. That's not to mention the fact I thought to myself, "I'll totally just also set up a blog on my website and write up everything I've been working on today, no problem" â€” and somehow thought that would all just work out.

So instead, here we are. Truth be told, I'm not actually sure what I'll be writing about on this blog, but I'll figure something out (or plan to, anyway). My record when trying to start a blog in real life was one entire post before I lost interest, so hopefully I can beat that one at least. Beyond that, who knows?

In any case, since I was originally planning to record a journal of my programming efforts today, here goes: today, I set up my blog. (But you knew that part already.)

This site is built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), so to add a bit of a nicer writing experience, I added [MDsveX](https://mdsvex.com/) on top of that. Oh, and there's a [list of all blog posts](/blog), currently just one item long, of course. Groundbreaking stuff, I know. But that's pretty much the entire gist of it.

It's pretty simple, but it works, so I'm pretty happy with it for now. I'll probably add an actual date utility library at some point, so I don't need to keep tying out timestamps for blog posts in ISO 8601 format, but I'm not overly bothered right now. On the bright side, keeping things simple means the ratio of time spent between setting up the blog and actually blogging isn't too shabby.

With that said, hopefully I'll have some more meaningful progress to journal about tomorrow.
