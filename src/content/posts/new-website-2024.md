It's been a while since I updated this site, and I figured it was around time to try out a new design as well. The content on the previous site was gradualy but noticeably becoming out-of-date, and the idea of starting anew from scratch just appealed to me somehow. It might even motivate me to actually post on this blog more often&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;it is a bit ironic, after all, that I now have pages to view blog posts per year while having only a single blog post from all of last year.

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I didn't really have any problems with the tech stack for my previous site, but Astro seemed pretty appealing for a fully static personal website that doesn't need any client-side JavaScript and just needs to display its content. There were some pain points, but the build-time data-fetching paradigm and type-safe [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) were quite nice to work with.

In addition to a new design and some ocntent updates, this blog actually has an [RSS feed](https://esfalsa.github.io/rss.xml) now! I don't know how I forgot about that on my last website, but well, it's here now. So if, by some small miracle, any readers out there prefer to keep up with new blog posts from their RSS reader, that's an option now.

Oh, one last thing: if you're interested in the design of this website, it's typeset primarily with [Public Sans](https://public-sans.digital.gov/) and uses a custom color palette created with [Palette](https://palettte.app/). Some sites that I found useful for inspiration and which may be of interest include [ben.page](https://ben.page/), [paco.me](https://paco.me/), and [causal.agency](https://causal.agency/).
