		<p>
			I’m Pronoun, though you may also know me as Esfalsa on NationStates. I’ve
			been playing NationStates on and off since September 2014, and have called
			the South Pacific as my home throughout that time.

		<p>
			In my free time, I also like to make tools here and there that improve my
			NationStates experience. Most projects are related to military gameplay,
			but I’ve also worked on some related to dispatches and roleplay.

		<p>
			Sometimes (very occasionally), I record some of my musings, journals, and
			other thoughts in my blog. Most posts are related to my code projects, but
			I sometimes also write about other things that interest me.
