			Hi! I’m Pronoun (also known as Esfalsa on NationStates). I first discovered NationStates in
			2014 and have been playing on and off ever since then. During that time, I’ve always
			considered the South Pacific to be my home, and it’s where my current nation has resided since
			I founded it in 2015.
		</p>
		<p>
			In TSP, I’m a legislator and thus a member of the Assembly. I’ve been a legislator since
			October 2020 and was previously a legislator from January to July 2016, November 2016 to
			February 2018, and October 2018 to March 2020.
		</p>
		<p>
			I’m also a member of the South Pacific Special Forces, holding the rank of Officer since April
			1, 2022. Additionally, I’m also currently serving as the Minister of Defense. Previously, I
			was a Trainee from January 11 to 28, 2022, and a Soldier from January 28 to April 1, 2022.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to gameplay, I roleplay as Esfalsa and (occasionally) the Central Bailtemmic
			Republic in the modern-tech Pacifica canon on the TSP forums. Outside of my own roleplay, I’m
			also a map editor for the regional map and contribute to articles on TSPedia, the regional
			wiki.
		</p>
		<p>
			Outside of NationStates, I’m a 17-year-old high school student (albeit one heading to college
			in a few months) with an interest in politics. In my free time, you’ll often find me listening
			to podcasts or playing a little too much Tetris for my own good.
